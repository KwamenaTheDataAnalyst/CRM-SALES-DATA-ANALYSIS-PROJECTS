# CRM-SALES-DATA-ANALYSIS-PROJECTS
In this project, I engaged with a real-world dataset using SQL (Postgres) and Excel for data management and visualization. The dataset includes information about accounts, products, sales pipelines, and sales teams. My goal was to uncover insights that can help a hypothetical company optimize their sales strategies and drive growth. 
This Repository contains project write up, sql query files, and Excel Workbook(Dashboard) that covered the entire project.
